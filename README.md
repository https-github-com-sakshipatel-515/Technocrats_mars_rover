# Technocrats_mars_rover
We are interested in developing various Interactive and Dynamic websites. We are very Enthusiastic and Inquisitive Learners of Technology, who are always willing to learn and work accross Technologies and Domains.We had a great Experience in Building this website under the Guidance of Mentors of Microsoft, India and we got to learn various new Technologies and Algorithms that we have incorporated in our project.

# Overview
 Pathfinding Visualizer allows the Rover to find and visualise the Shortest Path among all the paths between Source node and Destination node in the presence of various Obstacles after the Rover has reached Mars. The visualizer also enables us to add **‘Crater node’**, **‘Additional Station Node’**, **'a Maze or a Pattern’** in the grid from a variety of Mazes and Patterns and also allows us to choose the speed of the Rover. Pathfinding Visualizer also has the feature of **‘Graphical Visualization’** where a Source and Destination node can be chosen in the selected Graph and the Shortest path between the two is depicted through the Edges, also showing visited and unvisited nodes. 
 
## Path Finding Visualizer
 Path Finding Visualizer assists in visualizing the different algorithms and uses them to find the shortest path between Source node and Destination node by avoiding various obstacles.
 
The various algorithms that are supported are-
**Dijkstra’s Algorithm,**
**A* Search,**
**CDA(Combination of Dijkstra’s and A*) Algorithm,**
**Convergent CDA Algorithm,**
**Biderectional CDA Algorithm,**
**Greedy Best First Search,**
**Breadth First Search,**
**Depth First Search,** 

 Some of the Features of our Visualizer are as follows:
 **Additional Station Node,**
 **Crater Node,**
 **Mazes and Patterns,**
 **Speed**
 
 ## Graphical Visualizer
 Graphical visualizer lets you find the shortest path between Source and Destination node. Algorithm used in this visualizer to find the shortest path between two nodes is Dijkstra’s algorithm. The visualizer generates random graphs and the user can choose a Source and Destination node, placing it as desired. Upon clicking the Begin button the shortest path between the nodes is displayed. After the shortest path exhibition, Reset button is available for resetting the graph. Along with the features above a New Graph button feature is provided for generating new and random graphs.
